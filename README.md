Steven, Ali and Laurens Group Project.1



As for our First Class Project we have a website application that shows the functionality of a to-do list calendar, with positive feedback. 

Our To-Do list calendar will feature a 7 day period of days that we will switch to from November 4th, to November 9th. With our website we are able to click on the Create button to add more to-do list items. When we need to we can click on the Edit button to change the name and description.  

When we click on the Mark as done button, we are able to mark it as done with a positive feed back message. Our application is responsive, uses client-side storage to store data and is interactive. 


# User Story 

As a User, I want to use a to-do list that helps me feel motivated.

So that I can consistently stay on track with my schedule and feel encouraged.


# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I will use the to-do list to log my daily tasks.

WHEN I click on the create button

THEN I will be able to create a to do item 

WHEN I click on the create button, the date, name and description will be saved and displayed

WHEN I click on the next and previous buttons
THEN it loads up the tasks for that respective day

WHEN I click on the EDIT button, it loads up the specific day of tasks I have chosen
THEN I am able to edit the contents 

WHEN I hit the mark button
THEN It will display that my tasks are done, and positive feedback will pop up through speech.

# Process

The technologies used were Github, Figma, Slack and Google Meets. The tasks and roles are broken down and assigned through Kanban, we were able to communicate to each other and delegate or help each other with specific tasks. We all brain stormed with the mockup, and decided we wanted to have a positivity theme, Ali searched up colors that evoke motivation, tranquility and optmism, Steven made the figma wireframe look very cohesive and eye catching. As a base, Ali worked on the HTML and configured Bootstrap, and when we had the base HTML, Lauren worked on the javascript and Ali refined the javascript. Ali and Steven both worked on enhancing the HTML and CSS and then we continued to trouble shoot our code while deploying frequently. 


The challenges we had would probably be time management and figuring out specific things like github, javascript functionality and having conflicting code.
